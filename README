The simplest thing is to add these folders to the "Sparkfun_Edge_BSP/examples" folder.  
I have edited the Makefile to try to remove all the relative references.. There may still be bugs...

On my setup, I have tried to make links in the examples folders to the location on my computer... I have not checked that my links are working yet.  I did this so it was easier to update the github repo.   I don't really understand how to use git submodules yet...
